# Raider Rumble
## Original Proposal
Our game is an abstract representation of those special instances when you meet a friend while walking around Colgate’s campus and bond with them through silly interaction. We contextualize it by designing stages to represent Colgate’s popular, scenic, and interactive hubs, where one is likely to encounter a friend or professor.  On these stages, the characters then proceed to horse around with each other such as by giving them slice tokens, giving each other fist-bumps, or high-fiving one another. The game finally ends when a character is made to go out of bounds, signifying that they head off to where they need to be (such as the library or class). Part of what makes interactions special are the ephemeral property of their duration. The victory screens are thus the characters models waving in farewell.

 ### Art Direction
In general we wanted to keep a block based style with semi-flat lighting. We were inspired to do this by the [Climbing the Hill]([https://www.cs.colgate.edu/~efourquet/cosc435/gallery/climb-the-hill/ClimbingTheHill.html](https://www.cs.colgate.edu/~efourquet/cosc435/gallery/climb-the-hill/ClimbingTheHill.html)) game. We used textures to improve the quality of some stages and models, however made sure that they aligned with the block style. Our sky boxes and font similarly are pixelated to match.



## Technical Description
* [Cindy:]([https://github.com/cindyvo](https://github.com/cindyvo))
	* Player models
		* Hierarchical modeling
			* Attached different geometries to existing geometries in order to connect the pieces and allow for flexibility in animating the different components
			* Ex. this.mesh.torso and this.mesh.torso.rightArm
		* Created general functions such as createPingu and createRaider so that it can be used to spawn at a specific location in the scene
		* A general create character function was made, which will serve as a general template for subsequent character creations
	* Attack animations
		* Developed attack animations for Pingu
			* All moves involved a constant which is generated by the current number of frames, which determines how long the animation would last and how fast/slow the movement would be.
			* Animations were made by moving a particular body part such as the arms, legs, or whole body, either by changing its position or rotating the body part.
	* User Interface
		* Although not related to graphics, elements of the user interface were implemented so as to make the game flow feel more complete.
		* Using an imported font, imported icons, changing the HTML and CSS elements, the title screen and main menu were made.
	* Platform Models
		* Hierarchical modeling
			* Using this method, I designed the blocks used in the Persson Hall stage
			* I added different bricks to the existing blocks (ex. block.brick1) and translated them and changed their colors to make them look similar to the bricks of Persson Hall

* [Kerr:]([https://github.com/Hanako-Ikezawa](https://github.com/Hanako-Ikezawa))
	* Initial stage instance organization
		* Helped to develop and organize the generalized stage instance with the player instances, sounds, images, and other resources that are utilized for the general stage
		* Field of Dreams stage design for blocks and sky box; randomization introduced with the grass boxes plastered on top of the block meshes for the block of the stage
		* Checked for the player intersection with the stage boundaries in order to determine lost stocks for the player
		* Manipulated the cube geometry to be more synchronized with the placement of the camera following the players; rotation of the sky box
	* Texturing
		* Organized the textures, images, new image loader for textures
		* For the modeling of the box, sky boxes for each stage instance, textures wrapped around invisible boxes and shapes, etc.
		* Processed images in order to conform to our art direction
	* Animation
		* Helped to design and implement the animation and hitboxes of the Raider character
		* Applied the textures to the particles with this character first
	* Miscellaneous
		* Timer within the game loop to help keep track of the current game session
		* Added music with the new audio loader for the stage instances

* [Leo:]([https://github.com/ColgateLeoAscenzi](https://github.com/ColgateLeoAscenzi))
	* I'm too tired to write this now
	* Basically all the starter code, game loops, logic, collision, block design, level generation
	* Physics, animation parameters, knockback and damage calculations, attack types
* [Ryan:]([https://github.com/ryanrios](https://github.com/ryanrios))
	* Lighting
		* Noon Lighting
			* Sky box uses basic material colored blue
			* Ambient Lighting
		* Sunset Lighting
			* Sky box uses phong material colored orange
			* Mixture of many different kinds of lights to try and achieve somewhat realistic sunset lighting.
		* Night Lighting
			* Black skybox
			* Low intensity ambient lighting
			* Small basic material spheres to simulate stars.
			* Spotlights that follow players.
				* Based off of Prof. Forquet's code for spotlight that follows a moving car.
	* Taylor Lake Stage
		* Modeling ice blocks, water blocks, and wood blocks
		* Falling snow animation
		* Use wood blocks to build the trees on Willow Path with the lights wrapped around them.
			* Wood blocks are a mesh consisting of a larger brown block and various smaller blocks + lights places throughout.
