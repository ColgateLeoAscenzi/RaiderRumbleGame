# Raider Rumble
**Original Proposal:** Our game is an abstract representation of those special instances when you meet a friend while walking around Colgate’s campus and bond with them through silly interaction. We contextualize it by designing stages to represent Colgate’s popular, scenic, and interactive hubs, where one is likely to encounter a friend or professor.  On these stages, the characters then proceed to horse around with each other such as by giving them slice tokens, giving each other fist-bumps, or high-fiving one another. The game finally ends when a character is made to go out of bounds, signifying that they head off to where they need to be (such as the library or class). Part of what makes interactions special are the ephemeral property of their duration. The victory screens are thus the characters models waving in farewell.
